# Geoprocessing in ArcGIS using ModelBuilder and Python

This project focuses on creating geoprocessing workflows in ArcGIS using ModelBuilder and Python. The workflows are designed to perform complex spatial analyses using raster images.

## Description

The project includes two main workflows:

1. **Slope Map Creation**: This workflow uses a raster image to create a slope (exposure) map. The slope map is a graphical representation of the steepness or gradient of the terrain.

2. **Hydrographic Model Extraction**: This workflow extracts a hydrographic model from a raster image. The hydrographic model represents the flow of water over the terrain.

Both workflows are implemented in ArcGIS using ModelBuilder and Python.
